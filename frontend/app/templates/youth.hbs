      Pilgrim is all about families. It’s about relationships with each other and with Christ. It’s also about providing love, guidance and support to our children and letting them know that Jesus Christ will be with them always. Pilgrim loves kids! In 1998, Pilgrim built a new 11 acre campus in Bellevue. The building design specifically has children in mind. Our Childcare Center has more than 150 children in attendance. The classrooms at Pilgrim are specifically designed for kids. The outdoor playground, playing fields and indoor gymnasium are also designed for kids.
